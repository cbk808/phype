= Floats and doubles =
At the moment, floats and doubles are parsed exactly as in Javascript, which differs from how PHP parses and interprets doubles and floats.

= String lookups with array syntax =
PHP supports looking up characters in a string with array notation. I.e. `$foo = 'bar'; echo $foo[0]` will output `b`. Trying to treat a string as an array in phype yields an error for the time being.
