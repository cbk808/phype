= Type representation =
Floats and integers are interpreted and parsed as in Javascript. There are some semantic differences in parsing of these in Javascript vs. PHP -- these need to be corrected.

= Character lookup via array syntax =
In PHP, if you have a variable containing a string `$a = "Hello world!";`, then `$a[0]` would return the string `"H"`. At the moment, phype throws an error if you try to use array representation for looking up a character in a string.
