#summary Known shortcomings, errors, and semantic differences that phype has compared to PHP.
#labels Phase-Design

= Semantic Differences =
=== Floats and doubles ===
At the moment, floats and doubles are parsed exactly as in Javascript, which differs from how PHP parses and interprets doubles and floats.

=== String lookups with array syntax ===
PHP supports looking up characters in a string with array notation. I.e. `$foo = 'bar'; echo $foo[0]` will output `b`. Trying to treat a string as an array in phype yields an error for the time being.

= Shortcomings or errors =
= Array assignment =
At the moment, assigning an array to a variable does not copy the entire array to that variable, as it should.

= Referencing variables =
Variable referencing would speed up eg. assigning an array into a variable. These have not yet been implemented.

= Syntactic sugar =
The phype implementation aims to be fairly broad at first. Syntactic sugar will be added later.
