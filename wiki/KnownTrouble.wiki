= Array assignment =
At the moment, assigning an array to a variable does not copy the entire array to that variable, as it should.

= Referencing variables =
Variable referencing would speed up eg. assigning an array into a variable. These have not yet been implemented.

= Syntactic sugar =
The phype implementation aims to be fairly broad at first. Syntactic sugar will be added later.
