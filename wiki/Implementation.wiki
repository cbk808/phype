== Optimizations ==

=== Direct branching ===
_TO-DO: FIND DOCUMENTATION THAT JSON LOOKUPS IS FASTER THAN SWITCH_

When we execute opcodes, we branch directly into a JSON-object containing our opcodes, rather than using a switch-based solution.

=== Object representation ===
Each object points to an overall class-table. Functions are not represented in the objects, but are referenced in the class table.

=== Byte-code generation of javascript-functions ===
_(NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)_

When javascript code is generated using Javascript's `eval`-function, the code is implicitly generated and stored as byte-codes, und thus functions as a JIT-compilation scheme.
